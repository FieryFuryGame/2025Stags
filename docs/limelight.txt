To Rotate Parallel (Facing):
1. Get angle the robot is currently facing towards, using a rotation on the gyrometer.
2. Get angles that are opposite to the angle the AprilTags are facing, based on field info.
3. Check if an AprilTag is seen, and get the angle to rotate towards based on the ID of the tag.
4. Check if the robot is looking to the left or right of the AprilTag.
5. Begin rotating in that direction, by basically simulating a controller input constantly.
6. Stop when you reach the correct angle.
7. Begin next step.
